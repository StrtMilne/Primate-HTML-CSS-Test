      Welcome to your Be a Developer at Primate Exercise.
      
      Please fork this project so you can work on your own version.
      ---
      
      This exercise will give you an idea of the type of work we do at Primate on a daily basis.

      The exercise consists of two tasks:
      1. Building the Card component (HTML and CSS).
      2. and connecting them with the presented graphical element
      
      The attached iframe is a reference to a mock-up of how the cards should look like and here's a link to Figma file where you can get more details:
      https://www.figma.com/file/zEJBOBhuFQmJKEX0jHXrur/Primate-dev-exercise?node-id=1%3A307 

      The list should:
      - allow for different length of the text
      - and different colour of connecting elements 

      You should be able to achieve it using flexbox and grid but we're open to other ideas.

      This is the element we recently build ourselves for one of the websites we are working on and it was quite fun to watch how different people tried to approach it differently.
      Some solutions are better than others. Although we provide design assets in original Figma file but we think it is better to build everything with HTML and CSS only.

      The font we're using is Quicksand (@import link in the CSS file)

      Spend as much time on it as you wish, but we don't expect you to take more than 2h. Most likely you won't have time to do everything in this timeframe, that's absolutely OK too. 

      If you want to leave us some comments about this task, explain your decisions, tell us what you enjoyed or hated, please use the HTML comments in one of the files.

      As final submission, please email a link to your own project fork to jobs@primate.co.uk and include your name somewhere.

      Thank you again for taking time to do this exercise, we really appreciate it.

      ---
      Good luck and ...
      ~ happy coding

      P.S. We've noticed that some browsers have issues running stackblitz but Chrome seems to deal with it best. You will have to fork the project to see everything correctly.
  
      P.P.S Don't worry if you can't get it working within the timeframe. It's not an easy task and requires some CSS creativity. We want to see how you would approach it and what you attempted to do.

OVERALL:

I was pleased with how the test went and managed to finish coding shortly before the two hour period elapsed. It was an enjoyable and tricky task with a number of small margins that needed to be observed to ensure things lined up properly.

Referring to Figma meant completing the initial cards was a simple task and I was able to move through that portion fairly quickly.

POSITIVES:

- I'm pleased with my approach mapping out how I saw the elements coming together and taking it on incrementally, creating the cards first then adding the lines and finally ensuring everything aligned properly.
- I was happy with my ability to adapt as my initial plan didn't quite fit a way to ensure lines were respinsive to text volume. It was satisfying to successfully refactor under a time constraint and come out with something that worked.
- There were a number of times when elements didn;t align as I thought they should but by reconsidering the figma/css dimensions I was able to determine my logic errors and rectify which was great.

IMPROVE:

- Have card container scale to window it is contained in.
- I would include colours used in the :root class so that cards/line can have style changed by editing only one line of code.
- I found determining the height of the bottom-line class quite tricky which took me a bit of time.
- I would like to include 'top dot' in the 'line-container' div for consistency/neatness
